  <p>Below are a list of upcoming events.  Even though you are on the English events page you may see events with Japanese text in them.  This is because we pull in events from our Meetup.com meetup group.  They do not offer a means to localize events in multiple languages, so we put both Japanese and English descriptions in events.  Japanese is at the top, English follows below.  We manage all events through Meetup.com and therefore you must have a Meetup.com account in order to RSVP for events.  If you would like to see our events list in calendar view please visit the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/TokyoHackerSpace/events/" target="_blank">calendar view</a> on our Meetup.com page.</p>
